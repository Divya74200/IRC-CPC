We were last working on peerdiscovery.py.
Peerdiscover.py allows us to connect devices on the same network. Just by defining the port. 
It kind of worked liked a mesh network, every device need to connect with every device. So even if one device disconnects other stay connected as previous.
We stress tested it with around 100 clients.
Some of the clients couldnt connect, i would say its stress handling abbility was aroudn 85%.
